In recent years, AI systems have become both more powerful and increasingly promising for integration in a variety of application areas. Attention has also been called to the social challenges these systems bring, particularly in how they might fail or even actively disadvantage marginalised social groups, or how their opacity might make them difficult to oversee and challenge. In the context of these and other challenges, the roles of humans working in tandem with these systems will be important, yet the HCI community has been only a quiet voice in these debates to date. This workshop aims to catalyse and crystallise an agenda around HCI and AI. Topics of interest include methods to collaboratively explore AI systems to identify unusual failure modes; identifying, methods to capture and replicate social practices of critical engagement and oversight with AI systems; integrating insights from AI systems with complementary human insights; avoiding over- and under-reliance while preserving enjoyable user experiences; creating useable ML/AI systems for HCI practitioners; and modes of engagement with novel AI 'users', such as those captured and represented in training sets.
